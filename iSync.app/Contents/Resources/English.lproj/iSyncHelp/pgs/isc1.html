(Note: If you're using iTunes 4.8 or later, you use iTunes, not iSync, to sync your iPod.)<br><br>iSync compares the contact and calendar information on your computer with the address and contact information on your devices, and then updates your computer and devices to have the same information. For example, if you change someone's email address on your phone and then use iSync to sync the phone with your computer, the email address will be changed in any applications on your computer that work with Mac OS X synchronization services (for example, Address Book), and have a record for that same person. <br><br>If you change the same piece of information in more than one place, iSync updates all your devices with one version of the information, and stores the other versions in the Conflict Resolver. You can choose to resolve these conflicts at any time by opening the Conflict Resolver window (in the sync menu on the right side of the menu bar; you can turn on this menu in iSync preferences). For more information about how synchronization works, click &quot;Tell me more.&quot;<br><br>For iSync to work, you need to store your contacts and calendar information in an application that works with Mac OS X synchronization, such as Address Book or iCal. You also need to set up your devices in iSync on the computer with which you plan to sync (you should sync your phone and Palm OS device with only one computer). Once your devices are set up correctly, you'll see them in the iSync window. <br><br>For a list of devices that work with iSync, visit the iSync website at www.apple.com/isync/devices.html. </font></p></td>	</tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">	<tr>	<td><p><font face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif">If you have a .Mac membership, you can also synchronize information across multiple computers using the .Mac pane of System Preferences (in the Apple menu).

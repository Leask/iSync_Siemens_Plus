You might want to sync multiple applications on your computer, sync information on your computer and other devices (such as a mobile phone, Palm OS device, or iPod), or sync information across multiple computers. When you synchronize your information, all changes--including deletions--are transferred, so you always have the latest information available, no matter where you are or which device or application you're using. <br><br>The information or device that is synchronized depends on the settings you've chosen and the sync application you're using. For example, using iSync, you can synchronize the contact and calendar information on your computer with the contact and calendar information on your devices--such as a phone, Palm OS device, or your iPod. (Note: If you have iTunes 4.8 or later installed, you use iTunes, not iSync, to sync contacts and calendars to your iPod.)<br><br>Information (such as contacts or calendars) is stored as a &quot;record.&quot; For a sync to work, the record names on your computer and each device need to match exactly. For example, if on your computer you have a contact called David, but on your phone the same contact is called &quot;david,&quot; changes you make to David on your computer won't get synced to &quot;david&quot; on your phone. Instead, you'll see two records-one for David and another for &quot;david.&quot; For best results, make sure you've given the same label on each device to each contact and calendar whose information you hope to sync.<br><br>If you change the same piece of information (for example, a phone number) in more than one place, Mac OS X synchronization services updates all your devices with one version of the information, and stores the other versions of that information in the Conflict Resolver. At any time you can open the Conflict Resolver and choose which information to use on your computer and devices. To open the Conflict Resolver, choose the Conflicts menu item from the sync menu on the right side of the menu bar. If you don't see the sync menu, choose iSync &gt; Preferences and select the &quot;Show status in menu bar&quot; checkbox. </font></p></td>	</tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">	<tr>	<td><p><font face="Lucida Grande,Arial,sans-serif">Note: Record fields on some devices may have length limitations that affect how records are matched during the synchronization process. For instance, if your phone limits the number of characters that can be used to represent someone's name, the name may be shortened to what fits in the field. The shortened name would be used when trying to match information during a sync.<br><br>Before you can sync your computer and devices, you need to set up your devices to work with iSync.
